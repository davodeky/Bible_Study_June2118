		 <h4>Biblical Insights</h4>
		 <ul>
		 <li> He gives power to the weak, and to those who have no might he increases strength. Even the youths shall faint and be weary, and the young men shall utterly fall, but those who wait on the Lord shall renew their strength; they shall mount up with wings like eagles, they shall run and not be weary, they shall walk and not faint (<a href= "https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah+40%3A29-31&version=NKJV">Isaiah 40:29-31

</a>).  </li>
		 <li>Fear not, for I am with you; be not dismayed, for I am your God. I will strengthen you, Yes, I will help you, I will uphold you with my righteous right hand (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah+41%3A10&version=NKJV">Isaiah 41:10</a>). </li>
		 <li>When you pass through the waters, I will be with you; and through the rivers, they shall not overflow you. When you walk through the fire, you shall not be burned, nor shall the flame scorch you. For I am the Lord your God, the Holy One of Israel, your Saviorn (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah+43%3A2&version=NKJV">Isaiah 43:2</a>).</li>
